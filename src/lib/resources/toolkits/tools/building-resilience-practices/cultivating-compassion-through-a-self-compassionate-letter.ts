      description:
        "When we make mistakes or face difficulty, our inner dialogue often becomes harsh and judgmental. This practice helps you externalize and replace those patterns with words of kindness, understanding, and perspective—building a foundation of self-compassion.",

          note: "Avoid trying to 'fix' the problem—focus on acceptance and support.",
          details: [
            "Use phrases like: 'It’s okay to feel this way', 'You are doing your best', or 'You’re not alone in this'.",
