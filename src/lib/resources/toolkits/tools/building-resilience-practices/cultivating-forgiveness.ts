    introduction:
      "Writing a letter to express your emotions and consciously release the pain tied to a person or event—even if never sent—helps shift your internal narrative toward forgiveness. This practice encourages emotional release and allows you to take back your power by letting go of negative feelings and resentment.",
    description:
      "This exercise externalizes the emotional weight of an unresolved experience, allowing you to process and reframe what happened. It grants closure without the need for direct confrontation or reconciliation. The act of writing, reading, and releasing provides an emotional catharsis that paves the way for healing.",
