    introduction:
      "The first step in building a strong support network is identifying individuals who provide emotional, social, and practical support when needed.",
    description:
      "Support figures can be family, friends, colleagues, mentors, or community groups. Recognizing who these people are allows you to better understand where to turn for help during challenging times. This step involves more than just identifying people—it’s about recognizing the depth and type of support they offer.",

          description:
            "Start by listing people you naturally turn to when you need help. These could be family members, friends, co-workers, mentors, or even community groups. These individuals could offer emotional, social, or practical support, depending on their relationship to you.",

          "Consider not just those you currently rely on, but also people you might have turned to in the past. Think of those who were supportive during past challenges and reflect on the roles they played in your life.",
          "Include both strong and weak connections—those you lean on most and those you trust on occasion. This gives you a broader perspective of the network available to you, even if some connections are not as frequent.",

          title: "Evaluate the Type of Support",
          description:
            "For each person identified, evaluate the type of support they offer. Emotional support includes offering empathy and care, while practical support might involve helping with tasks or offering financial assistance. Informational support refers to advice or guidance. Understanding the type of support each person provides helps you reach out to the right person for the right need.",

        details: [
          "It may help to mark these categories on your list, such as 'emotional support', 'practical help', 'advice', or 'inspiration'. This makes it easier to identify who to reach out to when a particular type of help is required.",

            "Beyond categorizing support, it’s important to reflect on the depth of each relationship. Ask yourself whether these connections feel balanced or if some are one-sided. Healthy support networks involve mutual care and respect. This reflection will help you determine if you need to invest more effort into nurturing these relationships.",

        note: "Healthy relationships should feel reciprocal, with both giving and receiving support.",
        details: [
          "Evaluate whether these individuals genuinely offer support or if they only seek it from you. It’s important to assess whether these relationships are truly two-way, where both parties are able to offer and receive support in times of need.",

    title: "Map Out Your Support Network",
    introduction:
      "Once you’ve identified your key support figures, the next step is to visually map out your support network. This helps you see where your support systems are strongest and where they might need improvement.",
    description:
      "A visual support network map can help you visualize who is part of your support system and how they relate to each other.

For example, you may realize you have plenty of emotional support but not enough practical help when you're stressed or overwhelmed. Identifying gaps in your network can be an opportunity to reach out to new people or strengthen existing connections.",

        details: [
          "Consider the areas of your life where you feel the least supported. Identify people or groups who might fill that gap. Think about the type of support you’re missing and how you can find those resources in your current network.",
          "If you're missing certain types of support, think about joining groups or communities that align with your needs. Seek out social circles or online communities that could provide practical advice, emotional empathy, or even professional support when necessary.",

Are the connections strong and fulfilling, or are there some that feel one-sided or distant? Healthy relationships are marked by mutual care, and assessing the quality of each relationship helps you understand who is a core part of your network and who may need more attention.",

        note: "Look for areas where you might want to invest more time and energy to deepen connections.",
        details: [
          "If there are relationships that feel transactional or lack depth, consider how you can strengthen them. Think about investing time and emotional energy into these connections to make them more reciprocal.",
