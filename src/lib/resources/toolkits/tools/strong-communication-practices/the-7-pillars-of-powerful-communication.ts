            "When explaining a new concept, use real-life examples to connect it to the audience’s experience. In a tech presentation, compare a complex algorithm to something simpler, like following a recipe, to make it more relatable. If you’re introducing a new strategy, explain it by likening it to a familiar process, such as how a sports team plans its game strategy.",

During meetings, if someone says, 'We need to improve the workflow,' ask for specifics on what they mean by 'improve.'

            "Instead of giving a 20-minute explanation, break the information into smaller chunks and share key takeaways at regular intervals.",
