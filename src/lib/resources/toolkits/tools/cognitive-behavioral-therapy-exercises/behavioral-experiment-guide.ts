    introduction:
      "This activity challenges you to test a negative belief by treating it like a hypothesis. By planning a safe experiment, you gather real-world evidence instead of relying on assumptions. This reduces the grip of anxious thinking and encourages objectivity. The goal is to disrupt unhelpful predictions and build confidence in uncertainty. You learn to tolerate discomfort while observing outcomes non-judgmentally.",
