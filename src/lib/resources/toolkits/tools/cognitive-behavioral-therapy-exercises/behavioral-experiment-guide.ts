    title: "Testing Negative Predictions",
    introduction:
      "This activity challenges you to test a negative belief by treating it like a hypothesis. By planning a safe experiment, you gather real-world evidence instead of relying on assumptions. This reduces the grip of anxious thinking and encourages objectivity. The goal is to disrupt unhelpful predictions and build confidence in uncertainty. You learn to tolerate discomfort while observing outcomes non-judgmentally.",

    title: "Testing Social Fears",
    introduction:
      "This experiment helps challenge the belief that social situations will lead to negative consequences. By testing small, real-world interactions, you can gather evidence to counteract your fears. You'll learn that not every social situation leads to rejection, and often, your fears are based on assumptions rather than facts. This activity helps break the cycle of avoidance and fosters connection.",

    title: "Testing Perfectionist Beliefs",
    introduction:
      "Perfectionism can create high stress and lead to burnout. This experiment focuses on testing the belief that everything must be done perfectly. By purposely allowing for imperfection, you challenge the need for control and embrace flexibility. The goal is to demonstrate that mistakes are not catastrophic and can be learning opportunities.",

    title: "Overcoming Fear of Failure",
    introduction:
      "Fear of failure can paralyze progress. This experiment challenges the belief that failure is inherently harmful. By intentionally pursuing a task with the goal of learning, rather than achieving success, you reshape your understanding of failure. The focus is on learning from mistakes, not avoiding them.",

    steps: [
      { step: "Identify a task you are avoiding due to fear of failure." },

    title: "Challenging Catastrophic Thinking",
    introduction:
      "Catastrophic thinking magnifies small problems into big fears. This experiment encourages you to test the catastrophic predictions you often make and find out if they are realistic. By confronting the worst-case scenario, you often realize that it's not as devastating as it seems. This activity helps break the cycle of extreme thinking and builds a more balanced perspective.",
