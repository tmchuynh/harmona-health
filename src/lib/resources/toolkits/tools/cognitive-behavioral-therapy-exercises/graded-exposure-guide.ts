    description:
      "By planning and engaging in progressively challenging social scenarios, you can build confidence and reduce fear responses.",

      {
        step: "Identify a social situation you find moderately uncomfortable.",

    introduction:
      "Begin by identifying a low-level fear or discomfort you often avoid. This could be making a phone call, starting a conversation, or walking into a new environment. Graded exposure starts with manageable steps that slowly reduce avoidance behaviors. The goal is to increase your tolerance of discomfort in safe, planned ways. Over time, even small exposures build your confidence and control.",
