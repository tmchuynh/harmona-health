    title: "Identifying Automatic Thoughts",
    introduction:
      "This practice helps you tune into spontaneous thoughts that arise during emotional moments. Recognizing automatic thoughts is the first step in gaining control over them. These thoughts often go unnoticed but strongly affect our mood. By slowing down and labeling these thoughts, you increase awareness and reduce emotional reactivity. This sets the foundation for more rational and mindful thinking.",

      "A mindfulness-based reflection for noticing and writing down reactive thoughts.",
    steps: [
      {
        step: "Find a quiet space to reflect on a recent emotional experience.",

      { step: "Ask yourself, 'What was going through my mind at the time?'" },
      { step: "Write down any automatic thoughts that arise." },
      { step: "Notice any patterns in tone, judgment, or assumptions." },

    title: "Examining Evidence for Thoughts",
    introduction:
      "This mindfulness practice helps you examine how much evidence supports or refutes a troubling thought. Often we accept negative thoughts as facts without scrutiny. Slowing down helps us pause and review the situation objectively. You’ll learn to question how reliable your thoughts are. Doing so builds cognitive flexibility and inner calm.",
    steps: [
      { step: "Write down a specific distressing thought." },
      { step: "Ask yourself: 'What evidence supports this?'" },
      { step: "Now ask: 'What evidence contradicts this?'" },
      { step: "Compare both lists objectively." },
      { step: "Reflect on whether this thought is balanced or distorted." },
    ],
    conclusion: "Thoughts are hypotheses, not truths.",
    useCases: ["Cognitive Distortion", "Low Self-Esteem", "Worry"],
    approximateTime: "15–20 minutes",
    frequency: "3 times per week",
  },
  {
    title: "Emotion-to-Thought Linking",
    introduction:
      "This practice connects physical sensations and emotions to the thoughts that trigger them. Many emotional responses happen before we understand why. Through mindfulness, you slow down and trace the connection from emotion to thought. This process improves emotional regulation and awareness. It helps you respond instead of react.",
    steps: [
      { step: "Recall a recent emotional event." },
      { step: "Notice where you felt it in your body." },
      { step: "Breathe slowly and observe the sensation." },
      { step: "Ask: 'What thought preceded this feeling?'" },
      { step: "Write down the connection you notice." },
    ],
    conclusion: "Understanding emotions gives you power over your responses.",
    useCases: ["Emotional Awareness", "Anger Management", "Anxiety"],
    approximateTime: "10 minutes",
    frequency: "Daily or as needed",
  },
  {
    title: "Reframing Thought Patterns",
    introduction:
      "This activity helps you consciously reframe negative or rigid thinking using mindfulness. By identifying the unhelpful pattern, you create an opportunity to reframe with self-compassion and logic. This practice rewires your thinking pathways. It reduces mental rigidity and builds resilience. Regular use enhances flexible, adaptive cognition.",
    steps: [
      { step: "Identify a recurring negative thought." },
      { step: "Label the cognitive distortion (e.g., catastrophizing)." },
      { step: "Pause and take three mindful breaths." },
      { step: "Ask yourself: 'What’s a more helpful or realistic thought?'" },
      { step: "Write down the reframe and how it makes you feel." },
    ],
    conclusion: "You are not your thoughts—you're their editor.",
    useCases: ["Negative Self-Talk", "Rumination", "Perfectionism"],
    approximateTime: "15 minutes",
    frequency: "2–3 times per week",
  },
  {
    title: "Gratitude Anchoring",
    introduction:
      "This grounding exercise connects you to gratitude as a counterbalance to cognitive distortions. When distorted thoughts dominate, gratitude provides a clearer perspective. Mindfully naming what you appreciate shifts your brain's focus. This creates space for optimism, even during distress. It's a mental reset for calmer thinking.",
    steps: [
      { step: "Sit comfortably and take a few slow, deep breaths." },
      { step: "Name 3 things you’re grateful for in this moment." },
      { step: "Visualize each one clearly, engaging all senses." },
      { step: "Note how your mood and thoughts shift." },
      { step: "Write a short reflection in a journal or notebook." },
    ],
    conclusion: "Gratitude creates mental spaciousness and clarity.",
