    title: "Temperature Contrast Reset",
    introduction:
      "Using temperature changes can quickly reset your sensory system. The sudden feeling of heat or cold forces your attention onto your body, anchoring you to the present moment. This sharp contrast interrupts racing thoughts or emotional overwhelm. It's a simple but highly effective way to physically and mentally reset.",
    useCases: [
      "When feeling emotionally overwhelmed",
      "To ground yourself quickly after a stressful event",

    introduction:
      "Using intense flavors or textures (like mint, lemon, or ginger) can trigger an immediate sensory reset through taste. Strong flavors command attention and break mental rumination.

    title: "Weighted Object Reset",
    introduction:
      "Using a weighted object (like a blanket or heavy pillow) can provide deep sensory feedback. The feeling of weight is calming because it activates the parasympathetic nervous system, the 'rest and digest' response. This tactile pressure anchors your awareness to your body instead of your racing mind. It's especially helpful during anxiety or high stress.",

    title: "Intentional Sensory Walk",
