    question: "How is meditation different from mindfulness?",
    answer:
      "Mindfulness is an inherent quality of awareness that can be applied to any moment of your life. It involves paying attention to your thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment. Meditation, on the other hand, is a formal practice or technique designed to cultivate mindfulness. During meditation, you intentionally set aside time to focus your attention, typically through techniques like focused breathing, visualization, or body scans. While mindfulness can be practiced throughout your day, meditation provides a structured environment to deepen this awareness.",
